##The repository "Azure_Data_Pipeline_Project" by kareemNagah presents an end-to-end data pipeline utilizing several Azure services to extract, process, and analyze data from an on-premise SQL Server database. The pipeline is designed following the Delta Lake architecture, structured into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to manage data processing stages effectively.

Key Components:

Azure Data Factory (ADF): Serves as the orchestrator, automating data extraction from the on-premise SQL Server and coordinating subsequent transformation steps.

Azure Data Lake Gen2: Implements the Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw ingested data.
Silver Layer: Holds cleaned and transformed data.
Gold Layer: Contains aggregated data ready for analysis and reporting.
Azure Databricks: Handles data transformations:

Bronze to Silver: Cleans and standardizes raw data.
Silver to Gold: Aggregates and prepares data for analytics.
Azure Synapse Analytics: Facilitates efficient querying and analysis of the data in the Gold layer.

Power BI: Visualizes business-level data, providing insights and reporting for stakeholders.

Pipeline Workflow:

Data Extraction: ADF extracts data from the on-premise SQL Server, capturing metadata and dynamically looping through all tables.

Data Loading: Data is ingested into Azure Data Lake Gen2, following the structured Bronze-Silver-Gold approach.

Data Transformation: Azure Databricks processes the data through cleaning, standardization, and aggregation stages.

Data Analysis: Transformed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for advanced querying and analytics.

Data Visualization: Power BI connects to Azure Synapse to provide business-ready insights via dashboards and reports.

Key Learnings and Takeaways:

Utilizing ADF for orchestrating large-scale data pipelines.

Implementing the Delta Lake architecture to manage data processing stages.

Leveraging Azure's scalable infrastructure for data engineering tasks.

Ensuring data reliability and quality through transformation stages.
